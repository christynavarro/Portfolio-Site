    <h1>On The Rocks</h1>
    <picture></picture>
    <p>On the Rocks is a recipe-based app housing a variety of cocktail recipes. Users can sign up for a subscription service </br>
      to receive a monthly package with ingredients to create each recipe from home. The user will have access to a database </br>
      of several cocktail recipes where they can follow along to make their favorite cocktails at home or try something new.</p>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <picture></picture>
    <p>The first step of the design process was to begin identifying a target audience. Several user interviews were conducted</br>
      to get an understanding of what each user was looking for in a subscription-based recipe app. The research showed that users</br>
      valued easy to read recipes and placed high value on appealing imagery. Users wanted to use a platform that curated fun recipes</br>
      aligned with their personalized preferences.</p>
    <h2>My Process</h2>
    <picture></picture>
    <p>After determining the target demographic, the next stage in the design process was outlining the user flows. This helped</br>
      to identify different entry points and actions the users would take while navigating through the platform.</br>
      These tasks included the following:</br>
      1. Searching for different recipes.</br>
      2. Viewing the instructions for creating the recipe</br>
      3. Viewing what is in this month’s subscription
    <h2>Wireframing</h2>
    <picture></picture>
    <p>After outlining the user flow, I was able to design the wire frames, beginning with the low fidelity wire frames.</br>
      During the low fidelity wireframing process, I drew which UI elements would allow users to complete an action. </br>
      Once that was done, I was able to lay them out on Adobe XD to get a better understanding of the interface.</p>
    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <picture></picture>
    <p>Once the wireframes had been developed, a mood board was developed to establish the visual direction of the app.</br>
      Photos were incorporated to represent the type of imagery and mood that the app aimed to evoke from the users. </br>
      A preliminary color palette was developed, as well. The imagery used to inspire the high-fidelity wireframes use</br>
      bright colors and have a fun, refreshing feeling.</p>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <picture></picture>
    <p>On the Rocks was created for 3 different screen sizes. Each screen has been designed being mindful of different</br>
      break points to ensure a seamless user experience regardless of which device it is being used on.</p>
    <h2>Mock Ups</h2>
    <picture></picture>
    <p>After finishing the High Fidelity wireframe design, I created mock ups to show the final product in its intended use</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Many people get frustrated using recipe-based apps due to lengthy introductions, pictures that don’t give them an</br>
      accurate idea of what they’re making or find it difficult to follow the instructions. On the Rocks has solved these</br>
      issues by creating recipes that are straight forward and easy to follow along. The imagery used through out is clear</br>
      and instructions are laid out in a way that’s easy to read. Ingredient lists include pictures so the user knows what</br>
      to look for if they choose to make a recipe on their own. The layout is easy to navigate through to avoid users getting</br>
      overwhelmed with information.</p>
